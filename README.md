# MPhys_EAGLE

This repository stores the Python code used in Dominic J. Taylor's MPhys Thesis titled 'What Influences the Efficiency of Galaxy Formation?' carried out at the University of Liverpool in 2021 and supervised by Prof. Rob Crain. It includes:

## 1) compute_particle_quantities
Code used to compute quantities from particles in the EAGLE simulations by wrapping over the relevant periodic simulation box

## 2) BirthDensity_example
An example of code used to plot the EAGLE Ref-L0100N1504 simulation stellar mass-halo mass relation coloured by (log10 of the) Hydrogen number birth density and the median-subtracted quantity, with the running complete and reduced Spearman rank correlation coefficients
