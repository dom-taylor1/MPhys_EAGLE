# MPhys_EAGLE

This repository stores the code used in my MPhys Thesis titled 'What Influences the Efficiency of Galaxy Formation?' and includes:

1) [compute_particle_quantities] Python code used to compute quantities from particles in the EAGLE simulations by wrapping over the relevant periodic simulation box
2) An example code used to plot the EAGLE Ref-L0100N1504 simulation stellar mass - halo mass relation coloured by (log10 of the) Hydrogen number birth density and the median subtracted version, with the running complete and reduced Spearman rank correlation coefficients
