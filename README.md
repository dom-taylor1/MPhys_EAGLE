# MPhys_EAGLE

This repository stores the code used in Dominic J. Taylor's MPhys Thesis titled 'What Influences the Efficiency of Galaxy Formation?' undergone at the University of Liverpool in 2021 and supervised by Prof. Rob Crain. It includes:

1) [compute_particle_quantities] Python code used to compute quantities from particles in the EAGLE simulations by wrapping over the relevant periodic simulation box
2) [BirthDensity_example] An example python code used to plot the EAGLE Ref-L0100N1504 simulation stellar mass - halo mass relation coloured by (log10 of the) Hydrogen number birth density and the median subtracted version, with the running complete and reduced Spearman rank correlation coefficients
